This enumeration is essentially the union of 3 separate protobuf enums:
- The public [`Card.Brand`](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.connect.v2.resources.Card.Brand) enum.
This enum is what we present to external clients in our `/v2/payments` API.
- The internal [`CardTenderType`](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.common.tender.CardTenderType) enum.
This enum is what is used from a [`CardFilter`](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.payments.search.Filter.CardFilter#card_brand)
that is accepted by Spot's Search API. It includes 3 extra enum values not present on the `Card.Brand` filter
and also has an alternate name for 3 enum values.
- The internal [`InstrumentType`](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.common.instrument.InstrumentType) enum.
This enum is what is used within a [`CardTransaction`'s](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.esperanto.model.CardTransaction)
[`Tender`](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.esperanto.model.Tender) on a
[`PaymentRecord`](https://prototype.sqprod.co/#/docs/squareup.esperanto.model.PaymentRecord#card_transaction) within Spot.
It is just like `CardTenderType` (including the 3 extra values, and 3 renamed

Ideally we would only have a single source enum here. However, to handle the full dataset and all use cases
we need to cover, we have defined this as a union of these 3 enums. When an enum value exists on both the
public `Card.Brand` enum and the internal enums, but with a different name, we have chosen the public name.

An item variation, representing a product for sale, in the Catalog object model.Each item must have at least one
item variation and can have at most 250 item variations.

An item variation can be sellable, stockable, or both if it has a unit of measure for its count for the sold number of the variation, the stocked
number of the variation, or both. For example, when a variation representing wine is stocked and sold by the bottle, the variation is both
stockable and sellable. But when a variation of the wine is sold by the glass, the sold units cannot be used as a measure of the stocked units. This by-the-glass
variation is sellable, but not stockable. To accurately keep track of the wine's inventory count at any time, the sellable count must be
converted to stockable count. Typically, the seller defines this unit conversion. For example, 1 bottle equals 5 glasses. The Square API exposes
the `stockable_conversion` property on the variation to specify the conversion. Thus, when two glasses of the wine are sold, the sellable count
decreases by 2, and the stockable count automatically decreases by 0.4 bottle according to the conversion.

While JSON itself has no hard limit on the size of integers, the RFC-7159 spec
mentions that values outside of the range -9,007,199,254,740,991 (-(2^53) + 1)
to 9,007,199,254,740,991 (2^53 - 1) may not be interopable with all JSON
implementations. As it turns out, the number implementation used by JavaScript
has this issue. When you parse a JSON string that contains a numeric value like
`4693522397653681111`, the parsed result will contain a rounded value like
`4693522397653681000`.

While this is entirely a client-side problem, we want to preserve maximum compatibility
with common client languages. Given the ubiquity of GraphiQL as a GraphQL client,
we want to avoid this problem.

Our solution is to support two separate types:

- This type (`JsonSafeLong`) is serialized as a number, but limits values to the safely
  serializable range.
- The `LongString` type supports long values that use all 64 bits, but serializes as a
  string rather than a number, avoiding the JavaScript compatibility problems.

docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)

The fundamental unit of any GraphQL Schema is the type. There are many kinds of types in GraphQL as represented by the `__TypeKind` enum.

Depending on the kind of a type, certain fields describe information about that type. Scalar types provide no information beyond a name, description and optional `specifiedByURL`, while Enum types provide their values. Object and Interface types provide the fields they describe. Abstract types, Union and Interface, provide the Object types possible at runtime. List and NonNull types compose other types.
